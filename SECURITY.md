## Reporting a Vulnerability

- **Email**: `security@bitkaio.com`

## Disclosure Policy

We follow **coordinated disclosure**:

1. Reporter privately discloses the issue to the maintainers.
2. Maintainers confirm, assess impact, and develop a fix.
3. A patched release is published.
4. A security advisory is published after patched users have had time to
   upgrade (typically 7–14 days post-release).
5. Credit is given to the reporter unless they prefer to remain anonymous.

## Scope

In scope:

- The `codesteward-graph` and `codesteward-mcp` Python packages
- The published `ghcr.io/codesteward/codesteward-graph` container images
- GitHub Actions workflows in this repository

Out of scope:

- Issues in third-party dependencies that we don't bundle (report upstream)
- Denial of service from untrusted local input to the parser
  (the parser trusts local repo contents by design)
